## Task Types

### Upscaling Tasks

Upscaling tasks require miners to enhance video quality by increasing resolution while maintaining or improving visual fidelity. These tasks focus on **quality improvement** as the primary objective.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Primary Goal**: Quality enhancement and resolution improvement
- **Quality Metrics**: PIE-APP for scoring, VMAF for threshold validation
- **Content Length**: Dynamic processing durations (5s to 320s)
- **Scoring Focus**: Quality improvement with content length consideration

### Compression Tasks

Compression tasks require miners to reduce video file sizes while maintaining quality above specified VMAF thresholds. These tasks focus on **efficiency optimization** balancing file size reduction with quality preservation.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Primary Goal**: File size reduction with quality maintenance
- **Quality Metrics**: VMAF for both scoring and threshold validation
- **Compression Rate**: File size reduction efficiency measurement
- **Scoring Focus**: Compression efficiency with quality threshold compliance

---

## Quality Validation Metrics

### VMAF (Video Multi-Method Assessment Fusion)

VMAF serves as the foundational video quality assessment metric, comparing frame-by-frame quality between original and processed videos. This metric provides objective measurement of subjective video quality as perceived by humans.

#### Key Characteristics
- **Purpose**: Frame-by-frame quality comparison
- **Range**: 0-100 (higher values indicate better quality)
- **Usage**: Threshold validation and quality scoring
- **Industry Standard**: Widely adopted in professional video processing

#### Mathematical Implementation

**Harmonic Mean Calculation:**
```
H = n / (1/S_1 + 1/S_2 + ... + 1/S_n)
```

**Where:**
- `S_i`: VMAF score for frame `i` (i = 1, 2, ..., n)
- `n`: Total number of frames in the video
- `H`: Harmonic mean emphasizing poor-quality frame impact

#### Why Harmonic Mean?

The harmonic mean approach provides several critical advantages:

| Advantage | Description | Impact |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Sensitivity to Low Values** | Heavily penalizes poor-quality frames | Ensures consistent quality |
| **Quality Consistency** | Prevents miners from neglecting frame quality | Maintains processing standards |
| **Threshold Function** | Validates authentic processing processes | Prevents gaming attempts |

> **Note**: VMAF scores are calculated using 5 random frames for both upscaling and compression tasks.

---

### PIE-APP (Perceptual Image-Error Assessment through Pairwise Preference)

PIE-APP provides deep learning-based perceptual similarity assessment between original and processed video frames, serving as the primary quality scoring mechanism for upscaling tasks.

#### Technical Specifications

| Parameter | Value | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| **Scale Range** | (-∞, ∞) | Theoretical range |
| **Practical Range** | 0 to 5+ | Positive values (lower = better) |
| **Processing Interval** | Every frame | Default frame sampling rate |
| **Implementation** | Deep learning-based | Advanced perceptual assessment |

#### Calculation Process

**Step 1: Raw PIE-APP Score**
```
PIE-APP_score = (Σ abs(d(F_i, F'_i))) / n
```

**Where:**
- `F_i`: Frame `i` from original video
- `F'_i`: Corresponding frame `i` from processed video  
- `d(F_i, F'_i)`: Perceptual difference between frames
- `n`: Number of processed frames (4 random frames)

**Step 2: Score Normalization**
```
1. Cap values: max(Average_PIE-APP, 2.0)
2. Sigmoid normalization: normalized_score = 1/(1+exp(-Average_PIE-APP))
3. Final transformation: Convert "lower is better" to "higher is better" (0-1 range)
```

#### Visual Score Transformation

The PIE-APP scoring system uses sophisticated mathematical transformations:

## Upscaling System

### Upscaling Scoring

#### Quality Score Calculation

**VMAF Threshold Validation:**
```
If VMAF_score < VMAF_threshold:
    S_Q = 0 (Zero score for quality violation)
Else:
    S_Q = PIE-APP_Final_Score
```

**Where:**
- `S_Q`: Quality score for upscaling
- `VMAF_score`: Achieved VMAF quality score
- `VMAF_threshold`: Minimum required VMAF score
- `PIE-APP_Final_Score`: Normalized PIE-APP score (0-1 range)

#### Metric Integration

| Metric | Range | Primary Function | Usage |
|--------|-------|------------------|-------|
| **VMAF** | 0-100 | Threshold validation | Upscaling verification |
| **PIE-APP** | 0-1 (final) | Quality scoring | Performance evaluation |

---

### Content Length Scoring

S_L = log(1 + content_length) / log(1 + 320)
```

**Parameters:**

> **Dynamic Adjustment**: Weights are continuously optimized based on real-world performance data and network requirements.

#### Final Score Transformation

The preliminary score undergoes exponential transformation for enhanced performance differentiation:

**Formula:**
```
S_F = 0.1 × e^(6.979 × (S_pre - 0.5))
```

**Parameters:**
- `S_F`: Final upscaling score
- `S_pre`: Preliminary combined score

## Conclusion

The VIDAIO subnet validation and incentive mechanism represents a comprehensive, mathematically-grounded approach to ensuring high-quality video processing while maintaining fair competition and encouraging continuous improvement. Through the integration of industry-standard metrics (VMAF and PIE-APP), dynamic scoring systems, and sophisticated penalty/bonus mechanisms, the system creates a robust environment that rewards excellence and consistency while providing clear pathways for improvement.

The system now supports both **upscaling** and **compression** tasks, each with specialized scoring mechanisms:
- **Upscaling tasks** focus on quality improvement using PIE-APP scoring with VMAF threshold validation
- **Compression tasks** balance file size reduction with quality maintenance using dual-factor scoring
- **Unified penalty systems** ensure consistent quality standards across all task types

These metrics together ensure that miners maintain high-quality video processing standards while meeting demands for fast and efficient processing, creating a sustainable and competitive ecosystem for video enhancement and optimization services.
